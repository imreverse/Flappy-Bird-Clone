# Bang-The-Laptop-Bird
An attempt to imitate the functioning of the physics of the famous 2013 android game, Flappy Bird!
Added the functionality of using audio to upthrust the bird. One can *bang* the keyboard, to get this working. ;)
Run the program by executing the "index.html" file.
Made using **p5.js JavaScript library**, based on **Processing** language.

Credits goes to **Daniel Shiffman** for his amazing tutorials :D

## Known Issues and How to Solve Them:
1. Chromium-based web browsers block the loading of images due to CORS policy, for security reasons.
   This issue can be resolved by running the .html file on a local server instead of directly opening in a browser.
2. Chromium-based web browsers also don't recognize the AudioInput methods, due to security reasons.
   This issue can be overcome by running the local server on Firefox, instead of Chromium-based browsers.
